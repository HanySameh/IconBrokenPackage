Just another bunch of beautiful icons to use

## Getting started

first add dependance:
with flutter:
> $ flutter pub add icon_broken

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  icon_broken: ^0.0.1
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
Import it

Now in your Dart code, you can use:
> import 'package:icon_broken/icon_broken.dart';

## Usage

```dart
const IconData icon = Icon(IconBroken.IconName);
```

<!-- ## Example

```dart

```
